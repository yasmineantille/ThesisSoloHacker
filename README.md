# Thesis Solo Hacker

This repository contains the hardware source code and documentation of my master thesis Secure & Privacy-Preserving Two Factor Authentication on a Programmable Security Key.

Uses the [solo1](https://github.com/solokeys/solo1) open source code and the [solo1 cli](https://github.com/solokeys/solo1-cli) by Solokeys.
See [Solokeys' README](https://github.com/yasmineantille/ThesisSoloHacker#readme) for more information on the open source security key.

## Checking out the code
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yasmineantille/ThesisSoloHacker
```
If you forget the submodules in the clone, you can still get the files with the following commands in the corresponding directory:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

See [the wiki page](https://github.com/yasmineantille/ThesisSoloHacker/wiki) for further installation and build instructions.
